## Why

Have you ever updated a function but forgotten to update the `README.md` example that uses it? Or changed a list of
supported items in your code but forgot to update the corresponding list in the documentation?

Keeping everything in sync manually is tedious and error-prone.

## What

**BlockWatch** is a language agnostic lint tool that supports multiple types of checks:

- **Code consistency**: Track dependencies between code blocks - when one block changes, its dependents must be updated
- **Sorted lines**: Ensure that parts of your codebase stay properly sorted
- More validators are coming soon!

It keeps your codebase consistent by making dependencies and formatting requirements explicit and automatically
verifiable.

## How It Works

Blocks are declared in the source code comments: e.g. `/* <block> */` in C-style languages).

Every block

### Tracking Dependencies

Use the `affects` attribute to create relationships between blocks:

Mark a "source" block of code and give a name to a "dependent" block in another file (like
your documentation).

In `src/parsers/mod.rs`, we define a list of languages. This block is marked as
`affects="README.md:supported-grammar-example"`, creating a dependency link:

```rust
pub(crate) fn language_parsers() -> anyhow::Result<HashMap<String, Rc<Box<dyn BlocksParser>>>> {
    Ok(HashMap::from([
        // Will report a violation if this list is updated, but the block `README.md:supported-grammar-example` is not,
        // which helps keeping the docs up-to-date:
        // <block affects="README.md:supported-grammar-example">
        ("rs".into(), rust_parser),
        ("js".into(), Rc::clone(&js_parser)),
        ("go".into(), go_parser),
        // </block>
    ]))
}
```

In `README.md`, we define the block that depends on the code above:

```markdown
## Supported Languages

[//]: # (<block name="supported-grammar-example" keep-sorted="asc">)

- Go
- JavaScript
- Rust

[//]: # (</block>)
```

### Maintaining Lines Order

Use the `keep-sorted` attribute to ensure content stays properly sorted:

```rust
const MONTHS: [&str; 12] = [
    // Will report a violation if not sorted:
    // <block keep-sorted="asc">
    "April",
    "August",
    "December",
    "February",
    "January",
    "July",
    "June",
    "March",
    "May",
    "November",
    "October",
    "September",
    // </block>
];
```

### Ensuring Unique Lines

Use the `keep-unique` attribute to ensure there are no duplicate lines inside a block:

```markdown
# Contributors

[//]: # (<block name="contributors-unique" keep-unique="">)
- Alice
- Bob
- Carol
[//]: # (</block>)
```

```shell
# This command will now fail until README.md is updated
git diff --patch | blockwatch
```

This simple mechanism ensures your documentation and code never drift apart.

## Key Features

- üîó Dependency-aware blocks: declare named blocks and link them to keep code, docs, and configs in sync across files.
- üî§ Sorted segments: enforce stable ordering to prevent drift in lists and indexes.
- ü§ñ Git-native workflow: pipe git diff into blockwatch for instant, change-only validation before you commit.
- üõ†Ô∏è Pre-commit & CI/CD ready: first-class support for pre-commit hooks and a dedicated GitHub Action.
- üåç Broad language coverage: works with 20+ programming and markup languages out of the box.
- üß© Flexible extension mapping: map custom file extensions to supported grammars via a simple CLI flag.
- ‚ö° Fast, single-binary tool: written in Rust with no runtime dependencies.

## Installation

### From Source

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```shell
cargo install blockwatch
```

### Prebuilt Binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mennanov/blockwatch/releases).

-----

## Usage & Integration

### Command Line

The simplest way to run it is by piping a git diff into the command:

```shell
git diff --patch | blockwatch
```

### Pre-commit Hook

For automatic checks before each commit, use it with the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) framework.
Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: blockwatch
        name: blockwatch
        entry: bash -c 'git diff --patch --unified=0 | blockwatch'
        language: system
        stages: [ pre-commit ]
        pass_filenames: false
```

### GitHub Action

Add to `.github/workflows/your_workflow.yml`:

```yaml
# 
jobs:
  blockwatch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2 # Required to diff against the base branch
      - uses: mennanov/blockwatch-action@v1
```

-----

## Supported Languages

BlockWatch supports a wide range of common languages.

[//]: # (<block name="supported-grammar" keep-sorted="asc">)

- Bash (`.sh`, `.bash`)
- C# (`.cs`)
- C/C++ (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.h`)
- CSS (`.css`)
- Golang (`.go`)
- HTML (`.html`, `.htm`)
- Java (`.java`)
- JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`)
- Kotlin (`.kt`, `.kts`)
- Markdown (`.md`, `.markdown`)
- PHP (`.php`, `.phtml`)
- Python (`.py`, `.pyi`)
- Ruby (`.rb`)
- Rust (`.rs`)
- SQL (`.sql`)
- Swift (`.swift`)
- TOML (`.toml`)
- TypeScript (+TSX) (`.ts`, `.d.ts`, `.tsx`)
- XML (`.xml`)
- YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`)

[//]: # (</block>)

**Have a custom file extension?**

You can map it to a supported grammar:

```shell
# Treat .xhtml files as .xml
git diff --patch | blockwatch -E xhtml=xml
```

-----

## Examples

### Same-File Dependencies

Blocks can affect other blocks in the same file. Just omit the filename in the `affects` attribute.

```rust
// <block name="foo" affects=":bar, :buzz">
fn main() {
    println!("Blocks can affect multiple other blocks declared in the same file");
    println!("Just omit the file name in the 'affects' attribute");
}
// </block>

// <block name="bar">
// Some other piece of code.
// </block>

// <block name="buzz">
// One more.
// </block>
```

### Mutual Dependencies

Blocks can reference each other.

```rust
// <block name="alice" affects=":bob">
fn foo() {
    println!("Hi, Bob!");
}
// </block>

// <block name="bob" affects=":alice">
fn bar() {
    println!("Hi, Alice!");
}
// </block>
```

### Nested Blocks

Blocks can be nested inside one another.

```rust
// <block name="entire-file">
fn foo() {
    println!("Hello");
}

// <block name="small-block">
fn bar() {
    println!("Hi!");
}
// </block>
// </block>
```

## Known Limitations

- Deleted blocks are currently ignored.
- Files with unsupported grammar are ignored.
- Multiple blocks cannot be declared on a single line: `<block><block>will not work</block></block>`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A good place to start is
by [adding support for a new grammar](https://github.com/mennanov/blockwatch/pull/2).
