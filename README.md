## Why

Have you ever updated a function but forgotten to update the `README.md` example that uses it? Or changed a list of
supported items in your configuration but forgot to update the corresponding list in the documentation?

Keeping everything in sync manually is tedious and error-prone.

## What

**BlockWatch** is a language agnostic lint:

- üîó Dependency-aware blocks: declare named blocks and link them to keep code, docs, and configs in sync across files.
- ü§ñ AI-powered validation: Validate blocks against natural-language conditions using OpenAi-compatible LLMs.
- üî§ Sorted segments: enforce stable ordering to prevent drift in lists and indexes.
- ü§ñ Git-native workflow: pipe git diff into blockwatch for instant, change-only validation before you commit.
- üõ†Ô∏è Pre-commit & CI/CD ready: first-class support for pre-commit hooks and a dedicated GitHub Action.
- üåç Broad language coverage: works with 20+ programming and markup languages out of the box.
- üß© Flexible extension mapping: map custom file extensions to supported grammars via a simple CLI flag.
- ‚ö° Fast, single-binary tool: written in Rust with no runtime dependencies.

-----

It keeps your codebase consistent by making dependencies and formatting requirements explicit and automatically
verifiable.

## How It Works

Blocks are declared as XML tags in the source code comments:

```python
fruits = [
    # <block keep-sorted="asc">
    "apple",
    "banana",
    "orange"
    # </block>
]
```

Running the following command will validate the changes:

```shell
git diff --patch | blockwatch
```

### Tracking Dependencies

Use the `affects` attribute to create relationships between blocks:

Mark a "source" block of code and give a name to a "dependent" block in another file (like
your documentation).

In `src/parsers/mod.rs`, we define a list of languages. This block is marked as
`affects="README.md:supported-grammar-example"`, creating a dependency link:

```rust
pub(crate) fn language_parsers() -> anyhow::Result<HashMap<String, Rc<Box<dyn BlocksParser>>>> {
    Ok(HashMap::from([
        // Will report a violation if this list is updated, but the block `README.md:supported-grammar-example` is not,
        // which helps keeping the docs up-to-date:
        // <block affects="README.md:supported-grammar-example">
        ("rs".into(), rust_parser),
        ("js".into(), Rc::clone(&js_parser)),
        ("go".into(), go_parser),
        // </block>
    ]))
}
```

In `README.md`, we define the block that depends on the code above:

```markdown
## Supported Languages

[//]: # (<block name="supported-grammar-example">)

- Go
- JavaScript
- Rust

[//]: # (</block>)
```

This simple mechanism ensures your documentation and code never drift apart.

### Maintaining Lines Order

Use the `keep-sorted` attribute to ensure content stays properly sorted:

```rust
const MONTHS: [&str; 12] = [
    // Will report a violation if not sorted:
    // <block keep-sorted="asc">
    "April",
    "August",
    "December",
    "February",
    "January",
    "July",
    "June",
    "March",
    "May",
    "November",
    "October",
    "September",
    // </block>
];
```

Empty lines and spaces are ignored.

### Ensuring Unique Lines

Use the `keep-unique` attribute with an optional RegExp to ensure there are no duplicate lines inside a block.

- Default behavior (empty attribute): uses the entire line as the value to check for uniqueness.
- Regex behavior (non-empty attribute): treats the attribute as a Regular Expression. If a named capture group "value"
  is present, that group's text is used; otherwise, the entire match is used. Lines that do not match the regex are
  ignored.

```markdown
# Contributors

[//]: # (<block name="contributors-unique" keep-unique>)

- Alice
- Bob
- Carol

[//]: # (</block>)
```

Regex example using a named group to only consider the numeric ID for uniqueness and ignore non-matching lines:

```markdown
# IDs

[//]: # (<block name="ids-unique" keep-unique="^ID:(?P<value>\d+)">)
ID:1 Alice
ID:2 Bob
this line is skipped
ID:1 Carol  <!-- duplicate by extracted ID -->

[//]: # (</block>)
```

Empty lines and spaces are ignored.

### Validating Line Patterns

Use the `line-pattern` attribute to ensure every line in the block matches a Regular Expression:

```markdown
# Slugs

[//]: # (<block name="slugs" line-pattern="[a-z0-9-]+">)
hello-world
rust-2025
blockwatch

[//]: # (</block>)
```

Empty lines and spaces are ignored.

### Validating Block Line Count

Use the `line-count` attribute to ensure the total number of lines in a block meets a constraint:

- line-count="<50" ‚Äî strictly less than 50 lines
- line-count=">=3" ‚Äî at least 3 lines
- line-count="==10" ‚Äî exactly 10 lines

```markdown
# Small list

[//]: # (<block name="small-list" line-count="<=3">)

- a
- b
- c

[//]: # (</block>)
```

Empty lines are ignored.

### Validating with AI (LLM)

Use the `check-ai` attribute to validate a block against a natural-language condition using an LLM.
The model will return an actionable error message if the condition is not met.

Example:

```markdown
# Policy Section

[//]: # (<block name="policy" check-ai="The block must mention the word 'banana' at least once.">)
We like apples and oranges.
[//]: # (</block>)
```

If the content does not satisfy the condition, BlockWatch will report a violation.

#### Configuration

- Set `BLOCKWATCH_AI_API_KEY` env variable to contain an LLM API key.
- Optional: Set `BLOCKWATCH_AI_API_URL` env variable to point to an OpenAi-compatible LLM API (default:
  `https://api.openai.com/v1`).
- Optional: Set `BLOCKWATCH_AI_MODEL` to override the default model (default: `gpt-4o-mini`).

#### Security

When used in CI make sure it can be triggered by trusted users only.
Otherwise, an API quota may be exhausted.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

If you use Homebrew:

```shell
brew tap mennanov/tap
brew install blockwatch
```

- To upgrade later: `brew upgrade blockwatch`
- To uninstall: `brew uninstall blockwatch`

### From Source

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```shell
cargo install blockwatch
```

### Prebuilt Binary

Download a pre-built binary for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mennanov/blockwatch/releases).

-----

## Usage & Integration

### Command Line
[//]: # (<block name="cli-docs">)

The simplest way to run it is by piping a git diff into the command:

```shell
git diff --patch | blockwatch
```

#### Disabling Validators

You can selectively disable specific validators using the `-d` or `--disable` flag.

> NOTE: `--disable` flag can't be used together with the `--enable` flag.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Disable a single validator
git diff --patch | blockwatch --disable=keep-sorted

# Disable multiple validators (use multiple -d flags)
git diff --patch | blockwatch -d keep-sorted -d line-count
```

#### Enabling Validators

You can selectively enable specific validators using the `-e` or `--enable` flag.

Only the enabled validators will run the checks.

> NOTE: `--enable` flag can't be used together with the `--disable` flag.

**Examples:**

```shell
# Enable a single validator, other validators will not run
git diff --patch | blockwatch --enable=keep-sorted

# Enable multiple validators (use multiple -e flags)
git diff --patch | blockwatch -e keep-sorted -e line-count
```

##### Available validators

[//]: # (<block name="available-validators">)

- [`affects`](#tracking-dependencies)
- [`check-ai`](#validating-with-ai-llm)
- [`keep-sorted`](#maintaining-lines-order)
- [`keep-unique`](#ensuring-unique-lines)
- [`line-count`](#validating-block-line-count)
- [`line-pattern`](#validating-line-patterns)

[//]: # (</block>)

[//]: # (</block>)

### Pre-commit Hook

For automatic checks before each commit, use it with the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) framework.
Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: blockwatch
        name: blockwatch
        entry: bash -c 'git diff --patch --cached --unified=0 | blockwatch'
        language: system
        stages: [ pre-commit ]
        pass_filenames: false
```

### GitHub Action

Add to `.github/workflows/your_workflow.yml`:

```yaml
# 
jobs:
  blockwatch:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2 # Required to diff against the base branch
      - uses: mennanov/blockwatch-action@v1
```

```

-----

## Examples

### Same-File Dependencies

Blocks can affect other blocks in the same file. Just omit the filename in the `affects` attribute.

```rust
// <block name="foo" affects=":bar, :buzz">
fn main() {
    println!("Blocks can affect multiple other blocks declared in the same file");
    println!("Just omit the file name in the 'affects' attribute");
}
// </block>

// <block name="bar">
// Some other piece of code.
// </block>

// <block name="buzz">
// One more.
// </block>
```

### Mutual Dependencies

Blocks can reference each other.

```rust
// <block name="alice" affects=":bob">
fn foo() {
    println!("Hi, Bob!");
}
// </block>

// <block name="bob" affects=":alice">
fn bar() {
    println!("Hi, Alice!");
}
// </block>
```

### Nested Blocks

Blocks can be nested inside one another.

```rust
// <block name="entire-file">
fn foo() {
    println!("Hello");
}

// <block name="small-block">
fn bar() {
    println!("Hi!");
}
// </block>
// </block>
```

## Known Limitations

- Deleted blocks are ignored.
- Files with unsupported grammar are ignored.
- Blocks defined on a single line are all treated as modified.
